This repo contains Dockerfiles for applications that I find useful. 

- Whenever possible, binaries are hardened and images will be optimized for size
- Pull images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/kairlec/) and [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/users/kairlec/packages?repo_name=dockerfiles)
- Images are scanned daily using Trivy, Snyk and Anchore. See the [GHA workflow](https://github.com/kairlec/dockerfiles/blob/main/.github/workflows/scan.yml)
